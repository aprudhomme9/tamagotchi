My Lil' Guy is a Tamagotchi inspired game in which the main objective is to keep your pet alive.

In My Lil' Guy, the user must also satisfy their pet's blood lust to prevent the pet from killing the user.

The game features the following statistics:
	Hunger
	Sleepiness
	Boredom
	Blood Lust
	Age

The user begins the game by entering a name for their pet in the input field. This triggers the timer to begin running

Each second, Hunger, Sleepiness, Boredom, and Blood Lust increase by 1. The beginning value is 0. The values can not go below 0.
If Hunger, Sleepiness, or Boredom exceed a value of 10, the user's pet dies.
	When the pet dies, the user is informed of the reason for the pet's death, and must refresh to start a new game. An animation follows.

If Blood Lust reaches a value of 15, the user is killed by their pet.
	When the user is killed by the pet, the user is informed and the game is over. They must refresh to start a new game. An animation follows.

The user can prevent their own death or death of their pet by clicking defined buttons that explicitly say their purpose.
	One button feeds the pet, decreasing the pet's hunger by 3. The user is informed by seeing the hunger decrease and also through an animation of the pet image.

	One button gives the pet a nap, decreasing the pet's sleepiness by 3. The user is informed by seeing the sleepiness decrease and also through an animation of the pet image.

	One button plays with the pet, decreasing the pet's boredom by 3. The user is informed by seeing the boredom decrease and also through an animation of the pet image.

	One button, in red, decreases the pet's blood lust by 2. The user is informed by seeing the blood lust decrease and also through an animation of the pet image.

The pet morphs into different stages, shown through varying images of the pet, at certain ages.
	Their pet morphs at every even number age, starting at 2. The pet's final stage occurs at age 6.

Their is no way to win the game. The objective is simply to grow the pet as long as possible, and ideally through its final stage at age 6.
